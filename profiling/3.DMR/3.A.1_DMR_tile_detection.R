## quality check and basic features of the data
getMethylationStats(myobj[[2]], plot = F, both.strands = F)

## Experiments that are highly suffering from PCR duplication bias will have a secondary 
## peak towards the right hand side of the histogram.
getCoverageStats(myobj[[2]], plot = T, both.strands = F)


## It might be useful to filter samples based on coverage.
## The code below filters a methylRawList and discards bases that have coverage below 10X and 
## also discards the bases that have more than 99.9th percentile of coverage in each sample.
flt <- filterByCoverage(myobj, lo.count = 10, lo.perc = NULL, hi.count = NULL, hi.perc = 99.9)

## In order to do further analysis, we will need to get the bases covered in all samples. 
## The following function will merge all samples to one object for base-pair locations that are covered in all samples.
meth = unite(myobj, destrand = FALSE)

## This function will either plot scatter plot and correlation coefficients or just print a correlation matrix.
getCorrelation(meth, plot = T)

## Clustering your samples based on the methylation profiles
clusterSamples(meth, dist = "correlation", method = "ward", plot = TRUE)

PCASamples(meth)


## Depending on the sample size per each set it will either use Fisherâ€™s exact or logistic regression to calculate P-values.
## P-values will be adjusted to Q-values.
myDiff = calculateDiffMeth(meth, num.cores = 2)


## get hyper methylated bases
myDiff25p.hyper = get.methylDiff(myDiff, difference = 25, qvalue = 0.01, type = "hyper")
## get hypo methylated bases
myDiff25p.hypo = get.methylDiff(myDiff, difference = 25, qvalue = 0.01, type = "hypo")
## get all differentially methylated bases
myDiff25p = get.methylDiff(myDiff, difference = 25, qvalue = 0.01)
