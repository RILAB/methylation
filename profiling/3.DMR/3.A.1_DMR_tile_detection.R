## It might be useful to filter samples based on coverage.
## The code below filters a methylRawList and discards bases that have coverage below 10X and 
## also discards the bases that have more than 99.9th percentile of coverage in each sample.

## In order to do further analysis, we will need to get the bases covered in all samples. 
## The following function will merge all samples to one object for base-pair locations that are covered in all samples.
